## Mitchell's Portfolio

## Description

- My motivation to build this project was to create a "one-stop-shop" for anybody interested in learning more about me and finding ways to contact me.
- I built this project to facilitate the process of finding out information about me and what I've done.
- It solves the problem of having to search for contact information/completed projects, as they're all on one site.
- During this project I learned how to build a website from the ground up and troubleshoot problems of my own creation.
